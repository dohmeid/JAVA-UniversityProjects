Nice program asks user to enter three integers from keyboard (java console), the three integers
represent left bound, right bound and arbitrary digit ‘m’, where left bound is less than right bound.
Program prints all nice numbers in the given range that doesn’t contain digit 'm'.
The number is nice if its every digit is larger than the sum of digits which are on the right side of that digit. For example
741 is a nice number since 4> 1, and 7> 4+1. with digit m=2
